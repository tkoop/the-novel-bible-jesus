# The Novel Bible: Jesus and His Followers

This project endevours to take a Bible translation of the books of Luke and Acts, and transform them into an .epub file and a PDF to be read electronically and in print form.  There will be no verse numbers nor chapter numbers.  The final format will resemble a novel as good as we can make it.

## Guidlines
- We will not show verse numbers 
- We will not show chapter numbers (in the traditional Bible sense of the term chapter)
- We will have chapters in the tradition of a novel
- We will not modify the text of the transation at all to make it read more like a novel or anything like that.  The words will be a correct translation by the translators.

## To Do list:
- [ ] Find a translation
- [ ] Get the contents of Luke and Acts, and transform them into the format we want
- [ ] Decide on what to do about chapters, since we want to maintain the concept of chapters in the traditional novel sense of the word, not the Bible publishing concept of chapters.
- [ ] Decide where to divide the chapters and scenes
- [ ] Create the epub file
- [ ] Create the PDF
